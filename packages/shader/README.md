# @strudel/shader

Helpers for drawing shader.

## Todos

Here are the things that needs to be implemented:

- [ ] Shader compilation error reporting, e.g. to show the line number
- [ ] Shader import from url, like shadertoy or git
- [ ] Display shader author attribution, e.g. to respect CC-BY
- [ ] Handle WebGL context lost by restoring the objects.
- [ ] Multiple instances and custom canvas positions
- [ ] Multiple programs, to be swapped like a pattern
- [ ] Texture inputs
- [ ] Buffer inputs, e.g. to generate a texture
