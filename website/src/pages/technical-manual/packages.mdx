## Strudel Packages

The [strudel repo](github.com/tidalcycles/strudel) is organized into packages, using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces).
Publishing packages is done with [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).

There are different packages for different purposes. They..

- split up the code into smaller chunks
- can be selectively used to implement some sort of time based system

[See the latest published packages on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40strudel.cycles).

### Important bits

- The [root package.json](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/blob/main/package.json) specifies `packages/*` as `workspaces`
- Each folder in `packages` comes with its own `package.json`, defining a package name of the format `@strudel.cycles/<name>`
- Running `npm i` from the root folder will symlink all packages to the `node_modules` folder, e.g. `node_modules/@strudel.cycles/core` symlinks `packages/core`
- These symlinks allow importing the packages with their package name, instead of a relative path, e.g. `import { seq } from '@strudel.cycles/core'`, instead of `import { seq } from '../core/`.
  This works because the [bare module import](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#npm-dependency-resolving-and-pre-bundling) `@strudel.cycles/core` is resolved to `node_modules/@strudel.cycles/core`.
  In a project that installs the published packages from npm, these imports will still work, whereas relative ones might not.
- When a strudel package is importing from another strudel package, the package that is imported from should be listed in the `dependencies` field of the `package.json`.
  For example, [@strudel.cycles/mini lists `@strudel.cycles/core` as a dependency](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/blob/main/packages/mini/package.json).
- In development, files in any package can be changed and saved to instantly update the dev server via [hot module replacement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement)
- To publish packages, `npx lerna publish` will check which packages were changed since the last publish and publish only those.
  The version numbers in the dependencies of each packages will be updated automatically to the latest version.

### Building & Publishing

Currently, all packages are only published as ESM with vite flavour.
To build standardized ESM and CJS files, a `vite.config.js` like that is needed:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { dependencies } from './package.json';
import { resolve } from 'path';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [],
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: resolve(__dirname, 'index.mjs'),
      formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
      fileName: (ext) => ({ es: 'index.mjs', cjs: 'index.js' }[ext]),
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [...Object.keys(dependencies)],
    },
    target: 'esnext',
  },
});
```

This will build `index.mjs` (ESM) and `index.js` (CJS) to the dist folder.

### What's the main file?

Currently, each package uses the unbundled `index.mjs` as its main file, which must change for the published version.
There are 2 ways to handle this:

1. `main` = `dist/index.js`, `module` = `dist/index.mjs`. The built files are used. This means that changing a source file won't take effect in the dev server without a rebuild.
2. Use different `package.json` files for dev vs publish. So the unbuilt `index.mjs` could be used in dev, while the built files can be used when publishing.

Option 1 could be done with [workspace watching](https://lerna.js.org/docs/features/workspace-watching), although it might make the dev server less snappy..
Option 2 can be done by [publishing just the dist folder and copying over the `package.json` file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37862712/how-to-publish-contents-only-of-a-specific-folder).
Sadly, [this does not fit into how lerna works](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/91).
