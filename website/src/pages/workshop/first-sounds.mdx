# First Sounds

This is the first chapter of the Strudel Workshop, nice to have you on board!

## Code Fields

The workshop is full of interactive code fields. Let's learn how to use those. Here is one:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio")`} dirt />

<Box>

1. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è click into the text field above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
2. press `ctrl`+`enter` to play
3. change `casio` to `metal`
4. press `ctrl`+`enter` to update
5. press `ctrl`+`.` to stop

</Box>

Congratulations, you are now live coding!

## Sounds

We have just played a sound with `sound` like this:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio")`} />

<Box>

`casio` is one of many standard sounds.

Try out a few other sounds:

```
insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers
```

You might hear a little pause while the sound is loading

</Box>

**Change Sample Number with :**

One Sound can contain multiple samples (audio files).

You can select the sample by appending `:` followed by a number to the name:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio:1")`} />

<Box>

Try different sound / sample number combinations.

Not adding a number is like doing `:0`

</Box>

Now you know how to use different sounds.
For now we'll stick to this little selection of sounds, but we'll find out how to load your own sounds later.

## Drum Sounds

By default, Strudel comes with a wide selection of drum sounds:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh")`} />

<Box>

These letter combinations stand for different parts of a drum set:

- `bd` = **b**ass **d**rum
- `sd` = **s**nare **d**rum
- `rim` = **rim**shot
- `hh` = **h**i**h**at
- `oh` = **o**pen **h**ihat
- `lt` = **l**ow tom
- `mt` = **m**iddle tom
- `ht` = **h**igh tom
- `rd` = **r**i**d**e cymbal
- `cr` = **cr**ash cymbal

Try out different drum sounds!

</Box>

To change the sound character of our drums, we can use `bank` to change the drum machine:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh").bank("RolandTR909")`} />

In this example `RolandTR909` is the name of the drum machine that we're using.
It is a famous drum machine for house and techno beats.

<Box>

Try changing `RolandTR909` to one of

- `AkaiLinn`
- `RhythmAce`
- `RolandTR808`
- `RolandTR707`
- `ViscoSpaceDrum`

There are a lot more, but let's keep it simple for now

ü¶• Pro-Tip: Mark a name via double click. Then just copy and paste!

</Box>

## Sequences

In the last example, we already saw that you can play multiple sounds in a sequence by separating them with a space:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd hh")`} punchcard />

Notice how the currently playing sound is highlighted in the code and also visualized below.

<Box>

Try adding more sounds to the sequence!

</Box>

**The longer the sequence, the faster it runs**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd bd hh bd rim bd hh bd")`} punchcard />

The content of a sequence will be squished into what's called a cycle. A cycle is 2s long by default.

**One per cycle with `< .. >`**

Here is the same sequence, but this time sourrounded with `< .. >` (angle brackets):

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("<bd bd hh bd rim bd hh bd>")`} punchcard />

This will play only one sound per cycle. With these brackets, the tempo doesn't change when we add or remove elements!

Because this is now very slow, we can speed it up again like this:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("<bd bd hh bd rim bd hh bd>*8")`} punchcard />

Here, the `*8` means we make the whole thing 8 times faster.

<Box>

Wait a minute, isn't this the same as without `< ... >*8`? Why do we need it then?

That's true, the special thing about this notation is that the tempo won't change when you add or remove elements, try it!

Try also changing the number at the end to change the tempo!

</Box>

**changing the tempo with cpm**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("<bd hh rim hh>*8").cpm(90/4)`} punchcard />

<Box>

cpm = cycles per minute

By default, the tempo is 30 cycles per minute = 120/4 = 1 cycle every 2 seconds

In western music terms, you could say the above are 8ths notes at 90bpm in 4/4 time.
But don't worry if you don't know these terms, as they are not required to make music with Strudel.

</Box>

**Add a rests in a sequence with '-' or '~'**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh - rim - bd hh rim")`} punchcard />

**Sub-Sequences with [brackets]**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd [hh hh] sd [hh bd] bd - [hh sd] cp")`} punchcard />

<Box>

Try adding more sounds inside a bracket!

</Box>

Similar to the whole sequence, the content of a sub-sequence will be squished to its own length.

**Multiplication: Speed things up**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 rim hh*3 bd [- hh*2] rim hh*2")`} punchcard />

**Multiplication: Speed up subsequences**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd [hh rim]*2 bd [hh rim]*1.5")`} punchcard />

**Multiplication: Speeeeeeeeed things up**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*32 rim hh*16")`} punchcard />

<Box>

Pitch = really fast rhythm

</Box>

**Sub-Sub-Sequences with [[brackets]]**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd [[rim rim] hh] bd cp")`} punchcard />

<Box>

You can go as deep as you want!

</Box>

**Play sequences in parallel with comma**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh hh hh, bd casio")`} punchcard />

You can use as many commas as you want:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh hh hh, bd bd, - casio")`} punchcard />

Commas can also be used inside sub-sequences:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh hh hh, bd [bd,casio]")`} punchcard />

<Box>

Notice how the 2 above are the same?

It is quite common that there are many ways to express the same idea.

</Box>

**Multiple Lines with backticks**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`sound(\`bd*2, - cp, 
- - - oh, hh*4,
[- casio]*2\`)`}
  punchcard
/>

**selecting sample numbers separately**

Instead of using ":", we can also use the `n` function to select sample numbers:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 [4 2] 3*2").sound("jazz")`} punchcard />

This is shorter and more readable than:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("jazz:0 jazz:1 [jazz:4 jazz:2] jazz:3*2")`} punchcard />

## Recap

Now we've learned the basics of the so called Mini-Notation, the rhythm language of Tidal.
This is what we've learned so far:

| Concept           | Syntax   | Description                               | Example                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sequence          | space    | Play sounds one after another             | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd bd sd hh bd cp sd hh")`} />   |
| Sample Number     | :x       | Select a specific sample from a sound     | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh:0 hh:1 hh:2 hh:3")`} />       |
| Rests             | - or ~   | Add silence into the sequence             | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("metal ~ jazz jazz:1")`} />       |
| Alternate         | \<\>     | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("<bd hh rim oh bd rim>")`} />     |
| Sub-Sequences     | \[\]     | Group elements, squished into their space | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd wind [metal jazz] hh")`} />   |
| Sub-Sub-Sequences | \[\[\]\] | Nest groups within groups                 | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd [metal [jazz sd]]")`} />      |
| Speed up          | \*       | Make elements play faster                 | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd*2 cp*3")`} />              |
| Parallel          | ,        | Play multiple sequences at the same time  | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd*2, hh*2 [hh oh]")`} />       |
| Multiple-Lines    | \`\`     | Write sequences across multiple lines     | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={'sound(`bd*2, \n hh*4`)'} />            |

The Mini-Notation is usually used inside some function. These are the functions we've seen so far:

| Name  | Description                         | Example                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sound | plays the sound of the given name   | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [- bd] sd")`} />                     |
| bank  | selects the sound bank              | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [- bd] sd").bank("RolandTR909")`} /> |
| cpm   | sets the tempo in cycles per minute | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [- bd] sd").cpm(45)`} />             |
| n     | select sample number                | <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 4 2 0 6 3 2").sound("jazz")`} />           |

## Examples

**Basic rock beat**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`sound("[bd sd]*2, hh*8").bank("RolandTR505")
.cpm(100/4)`}
  punchcard
/>

**Classic house**

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd*4, [- cp]*2, [- hh]*4").bank("RolandTR909")`} punchcard />

<Box>

Notice that the two patterns are extremely similar.
Certain drum patterns are reused across genres.

</Box>

We Will Rock you

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd*2 cp").bank("RolandTR707").cpm(81/2)`} punchcard />

**Yellow Magic Orchestra - Firecracker**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`sound("bd sd, - - - hh - hh - -, - perc - perc:1*2")
  .bank("RolandCompurhythm1000").cpm(120/2)`}
  punchcard
/>

**Imitation of a 16 step sequencer**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`sound(\`
[-  -  oh - ] [-  -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ],
[hh hh -  - ] [hh -  hh - ] [hh -  hh - ] [hh -  hh - ],
[-  -  -  - ] [cp -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ] [cp -  -  - ],
[bd -  -  - ] [-  -  -  bd] [-  -  bd - ] [-  -  -  bd]
\`).cpm(90/4)`}
  punchcard
/>

**Another one**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`sound(\`
[-  -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ] [-  -  oh:1 - ],
[hh hh hh hh] [hh hh hh hh] [hh hh hh hh] [hh hh -  - ],
[-  -  -  - ] [cp -  -  - ] [-  -  -  - ] [~  cp -  - ],
[bd bd -  - ] [-  -  bd - ] [bd bd - bd ] [-  -  -  - ]
\`).bank("RolandTR808").cpm(88/4)`}
  punchcard
/>

**Not your average drums**

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`s(\`jazz*2, 
insect [crow metal] - -, 
- space:4 - space:1,
- wind\`)
.cpm(100/2)`}
  punchcard
/>

Now that we know the basics of how to make beats, let's look at how we can play [notes](/workshop/first-notes)
