# Control Parameters

Besides functions that control time, we saw earlier that functions like `note` and `cutoff` control different parameters (short params) of an event.
Let's now look more closely at how these `param(eter) functions` work.

# Parameter Functions

A very powerful feature of tidal patterns is that each parameter can be controlled independently:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
  tune={`note("c a f e")
.cutoff("<500 1000 2000 [4000 8000]>")
.gain(.8)
.s('sawtooth')
.log()`}
/>

In this example, the parameters `note`, `cutoff`, `gain` and `s` are controlled independently by either patterns or plain values (numbers / text).
After pressing play, we can observe the time and parameter values of each event (hap) in the output created by `.log()`.

## Plain vs Parameterized Values

Patterns that are not wrapped inside a param function will contain unlabeled `plain values`:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`"<c e g>".log()`} />

This will not generate any sound output, because Strudel could only guess which param is meant by these letters.

Now compare that to the version wrapped in `note`:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("<c e g>").log()`} />

Now it is clear that these letters are meant to be played as notes.
Under the hood, the `note` function (as well as all other param functions)
will wrap each plain value in an object. If the note function did not exist, we would need to write:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`cat({note:'c'},{note:'e'},{note:'g'}).log()`} />

This will have the same output, though it is rather unwieldy to read and write.

## Wrapping Parameter Functions

To avoid too much nesting, param functions can also be chained like this:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`cat('c', 'e', 'g').note().log()`} />

This is equivalent to `note(cat('c','e','g')).log()`.

You can use this with any function that declares a type (like `n`, `s`, `note`, `freq` etc), just make sure to leave the parens empty!

## Plain Value Modification

Patterns of plain values can be modified with any of the following operators:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`"50 60 70".add("<0 1 2>").log()`} />

Here, the add function modifies the numbers on the left.
Again, there is no output because these numbers have no meaning without a param.

## Param Value Modification

To modify a parameter value, you can either:

- Use the operator on the plain value pattern, inside the param function:

  <MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("50 60 70".add("<0 1 2>")).room(.1).log()`} />

- Similarly, use the operator on the plain value pattern and wrap it later:

  <MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`"50 60 70".add("<0 1 2>").note().room(.1).log()`} />

- Specify which param should be modified inside the operator function:

  <MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("50 60 70").room(.1).add(note("<0 1 2>")).log()`} />

Remember the execution of the chained functions goes from left to right.

# Operators

This group of functions allows to modify the value of events.

## add

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.add" h={0} />

## sub

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.sub" h={0} />

## mul

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.mul" h={0} />

## div

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.div" h={0} />

## round

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.round" h={0} />

## floor

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.floor" h={0} />

## ceil

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.ceil" h={0} />

## range

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.range" h={0} />

## rangex

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.rangex" h={0} />

## range2

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.range2" h={0} />

## ratio

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.ratio" h={0} />

# Custom Parameters

You can also create your own parameters:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
  tune={`let x = createParam('x')
x(sine.range(0, 200))
`}
/>

Multiple params can also be created in a more consice way, using `createParams`:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
  tune={`let { x, y } = createParams('x', 'y');
x(sine.range(0, 200)).y(cosine.range(0, 200));
`}
/>

Note that these params will not do anything until you give them meaning in your custom output!

From modifying parameters we transition to the concept of [Signals](/learn/signals).
