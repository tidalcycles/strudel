# Samples

# Default Sample Map

As we have seen, `s` can play back audio samples:

<MiniRepl client:idle client:idle tune={`s("bd sd,hh*8,misc/2")`} />

These sounds come from Strudels in-built default "sample map".
To know which sounds are available, open the [default sample map](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/EmuSP12.json).

# Custom Sample Maps

You can load your own sample map using the `samples` function.
In this example we create a map using sounds from the default sample map:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bd: 'bd/BT0AADA.wav',
  sd: 'sd/rytm-01-classic.wav',
  hh: 'hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav',
}, 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
s("bd sd,hh*8")`}
/>

When you load your own samples, you can choose the names that you will then refer to in your pattern string inside the `s` function.
Compare with this example which uses the same samples, but with different names.

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bassdrum: 'bd/BT0AADA.wav',
  snaredrum: 'sd/rytm-01-classic.wav',
  hihat: 'hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav',
}, 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
s("bassdrum snaredrum, hihat*8")`}
/>

Here we have changed the "map" to include longer sample names.

# Loading Custom Samples

The `samples` function has two arguments:

- A [JavaScript object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) that maps sound names to audio file paths.
- A base URL that comes before each path describing where the sample folder can be found online.
  - Make sure your base URL ends with a slash, while your sample paths do **not** begin with one!

To see how this looks in practice, compare the [DirtSamples GitHub repo](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples) with the previous sample map example.

Because GitHub is a popular place for uploading open source samples, it has its own shortcut:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bd: 'bd/BT0AADA.wav',
  sd: 'sd/rytm-01-classic.wav',
  hh: 'hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav',
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
s("bd sd,hh*8")`}
/>

The format is `github:user/repo/branch/`.

Let's see another example, this time based on the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/jarmitage/jarmitage.github.io.
We can see there are some guitar samples inside the `/samples` folder, so let's try to load them:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  g0: 'samples/guitar/guitar_0.wav',
  g1: 'samples/guitar/guitar_1.wav',
  g2: 'samples/guitar/guitar_2.wav',
  g3: 'samples/guitar/guitar_3.wav',
  g4: 'samples/guitar/guitar_4.wav'
}, 'github:jarmitage/jarmitage.github.io/master/');
s("[g0 g1 g2 g3 g4]/5")`}
/>

# Loading Multiple Samples per Sound

It is also possible, to declare multiple files for one sound, using the array notation:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bd: ['bd/BT0AADA.wav','bd/BT0AAD0.wav'],
  sd: ['sd/rytm-01-classic.wav','sd/rytm-00-hard.wav'],
  hh: ['hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav','hh/000_hh3closedhh.wav'],
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
s("<bd:0 bd:1>,~ <sd:0 sd:1>,[hh:0 hh:1]*2")`}
/>

The `:0` `:1` etc. are the indices of the array.
The sample number can also be set using `n`:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bd: ['bd/BT0AADA.wav','bd/BT0AAD0.wav'],
  sd: ['sd/rytm-01-classic.wav','sd/rytm-00-hard.wav'],
  hh: ['hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav','hh/000_hh3closedhh.wav'],
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
s("bd,~ sd,hh*4").n("<0 1>")`}
/>

In that case, we might load our guitar sample map a different way:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  guitar: [
    'samples/guitar/guitar_0.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_1.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_2.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_3.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_4.wav'
  ]
}, 'github:jarmitage/jarmitage.github.io/master/');
s("[guitar:0 guitar:1 guitar:2 guitar:3 guitar:4]/5")`}
/>

And as above, we can choose the sample number using `n` for even more flexibility:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  guitar: [
    'samples/guitar/guitar_0.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_1.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_2.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_3.wav', 
    'samples/guitar/guitar_4.wav'
  ]
}, 'github:jarmitage/jarmitage.github.io/master/');
n("<0 1 2 3 4>").s("guitar")`}
/>

# Pitched Sounds

For pitched sounds, you can use `note`, just like with synths:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  'gtr': 'gtr/0001_cleanC.wav',
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
note("g3 [bb3 c4] <g4 f4 eb4 f3>@2").s('gtr').gain(.5)`}
/>

Here, the guitar samples will overlap, because they always play till the end.
If we want them to behave more like a synth, we can add `clip(1)`:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  'gtr': 'gtr/0001_cleanC.wav',
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
note("g3 [bb3 c4] <g4 f4 eb4 f3>@2").s('gtr').clip(1)
  .gain(.5)`}
/>

# Base Pitch

If we have 2 samples with different base pitches, we can make them in tune by specifying the pitch like this:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  'gtr': 'gtr/0001_cleanC.wav',
  'moog': { 'g3': 'moog/005_Mighty%20Moog%20G3.wav' },
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
note("g3 [bb3 c4] <g4 f4 eb4 f3>@2").s("gtr,moog").clip(1)
  .gain(.5)`}
/>

If a sample has no pitch set, `c3` is the default.

We can also declare different samples for different regions of the keyboard:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  'moog': {
    'g2': 'moog/004_Mighty%20Moog%20G2.wav',
    'g3': 'moog/005_Mighty%20Moog%20G3.wav',
    'g4': 'moog/006_Mighty%20Moog%20G4.wav',
  }}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
note("g2!2 <bb2 c3>!2, <c4@3 [<eb4 bb3> g4 f4]>")
  .s('moog').clip(1)
  .gain(.5)`}
/>

The sampler will always pick the closest matching sample for the current note!

# Sampler Effects

Below are four different examples of sampler "effects" which are functions that can be used to change the behaviour of sample playback.
Note that most of what you've learned already about Tidal mini-notation can be used with these functions too.
Almost everything in Tidal can be patterned using strings!

### `begin`

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.begin" h={0} />

### `end`

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.end" h={0} />

### `cut`

<JsDoc client:idle name="cut" h={0} />

### `loopAt`

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.loopAt" h={0} />

### `chop`

<JsDoc client:idle name="Pattern.chop" h={0} />

### `speed`

<JsDoc client:idle name="speed" h={0} />
