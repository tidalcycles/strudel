# What is Strudel?

With Strudel, you can expressively write dynamic music pieces.
It aims to be [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) for JavaScript (started by the same author).

You don't need to know JavaScript or Tidal Cycles to make music with Strudel.

This interactive tutorial will guide you through the basics of Strudel.

The best place to actually make music with Strudel is the [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/).

## Show me a Demo

To get a taste of what Strudel can do, check out this track:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`samples({
  bd: ['bd/BT0AADA.wav','bd/BT0AAD0.wav','bd/BT0A0DA.wav','bd/BT0A0D3.wav','bd/BT0A0D0.wav','bd/BT0A0A7.wav'],
  sd: ['sd/rytm-01-classic.wav','sd/rytm-00-hard.wav'],
  hh: ['hh27/000_hh27closedhh.wav','hh/000_hh3closedhh.wav'],
}, 'github:tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/master/');
stack(
s("bd,[~ <sd!3 sd(3,4,2)>],hh(3,4)") // drums
.speed(perlin.range(.7,.9)) // random sample speed variation
,"<a1 b1\*2 a1(3,8) e2>" // bassline
.off(1/8,x=>x.add(12).degradeBy(.5)) // random octave jumps
.add(perlin.range(0,.5)) // random pitch variation
.superimpose(add(.05)) // add second, slightly detuned voice
.n() // wrap in "n"
.decay(.15).sustain(0) // make each note of equal length
.s('sawtooth') // waveform
.gain(.4) // turn down
.cutoff(sine.slow(7).range(300,5000)) // automate cutoff
,"<Am7!3 <Em7 E7b13 Em7 Ebm7b5>>".voicings('lefthand') // chords
.superimpose(x=>x.add(.04)) // add second, slightly detuned voice
.add(perlin.range(0,.5)) // random pitch variation
.n() // wrap in "n"
.s('sawtooth') // waveform
.gain(.16) // turn down
.cutoff(500) // fixed cutoff
.attack(1) // slowly fade in
)
.slow(3/2)`}

# Playing Pitches

Pitches are an essential building block for music. In Strudel, there are 3 different options to express a pitch:

- `note`: letter notation
- `n`: number notation
- `freq`: frequency notation

## note

Notes are notated with the note letter, followed by the octave number. You can notate flats with `b` and sharps with `#`.

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("a3 c#4 e4 a4")`} />

By the way, you can edit the contents of the player, and press "update" to hear your change!
You can also press "play" on the next player without needing to stop the last one.

## n

If you don't like notes, you can also use numbers with `n` instead:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`n("57 61 64 69")`} />

These numbers are interpreted as so called midi numbers, where adjacent whole numbers are 1 semitone apart.
You could also write decimal numbers to get microtonal pitches:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`n("74.5 75 75.5 76")`} />

## freq

To get maximum freedom, you can also use `freq` to directly control the frequency:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`freq("220 275 330 440")`} />

In this example, we play A3 (220Hz), C#4 natural (275Hz), E4 (330Hz) and A4 (440Hz).

<br />

# Playing Sounds

Instead of pitches, we can also play sounds with `s`:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`s("bd hh sd hh")`} />

Similarly, we can also use `s` to change the sound of our pitches:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("a3 c#4 e4 a4").s("sawtooth")`} />

Try changing the sound to `square`, `triangle` or `sine`!

We will go into the defails of sounds and synths [later](http://localhost:3000/tutorial/#web-audio-output).

<br />

# Syntax

So far, we've seen the following syntax:

```
xxx("foo").yyy("bar")
```

Generally, `xxx` and `yyy` are called functions, while `foo` and `bar` are called function arguments.
So far, we've used the functions to declare which aspect of the sound we want to control, and their arguments for the actual data.
The `yyy` function is called a chained function, because it is appended with a dot.

Strudel makes heavy use of chained functions. Here is a more extreme example:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`note("a3 c#4 e4 a4")
.s("sawtooth")
.cutoff(500)
//.delay(0.5)
.room(0.5)`}
/>

The `//` is a line comment, resulting in the `delay` function being ignored.
It is a handy way to quickly turn stuff on and off. Try uncommenting this line by deleting `//`!

The good news is, that this covers 99% of the JavaScript syntax needed for Strudel!

Let's now look at the way we can express rhythms..
