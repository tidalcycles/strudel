# Sounds

We can play sounds with `s`, in two different ways:
- `s` can trigger audio samples, where a sound file is loaded in the background and played back:
<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`s("bd hh sd hh")`} />
- `s` can trigger audio synthesisers, which are synthesised in real-time using code also running in the background:
<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`s("sawtooth square triangle sine")`} />

You can learn more about both of these approaches in the pages [Synths](/learn/synths) and [Samples](/learn/samples).

# Combining notes and sounds

In both of the above cases, we are no longer directly controlling the `note`/`n`/`freq` of the sound heard via `s`, as we were in the [Notes](/strudel/notes) page.

So how can we both control the sound and the pitch? We can _combine_ `note`/`n`/`freq` with `s` to change the sound of our pitches:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`note("a3 c#4 e4 a4").s("sawtooth")`} />

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`n("57 61 64 69").s("triangle")`} />

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`freq("220 275 330 440").s("sine")`} />

What about combining different notes with different sounds at the same time?

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`freq("220 275 330 440 550").s("triangle sawtooth sine")`} />

Hmm, something interesting is going on there, related to there being five notes and three sounds.

Let's now take a step back and think about the Strudel [Code](/learn/code) we've been hearing so far.
