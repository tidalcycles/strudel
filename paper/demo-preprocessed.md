- abstract: The TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) live coding environment
    has been developed since around 2009, via several rewrites of its
    core representation. Rather than having fixed goals, this
    development has been guided by use, motivated by the open aim to
    make music. This development process can be seen as a long-form
    improvisation, with insights into the nature of Tidal gained through
    the process of writing it, feeding back to guide the next steps of
    development. This brings the worrying thought that key insights will
    have been missed along this development journey, that would
    otherwise have lead to very different software. Indeed participants
    at beginners' workshops that I have lead or co-lead have often asked
    questions without good answers, because they made deficiencies or
    missing features in the software clear. It is well known that a
    beginner's mind is able to see much that an expert has become blind
    to. Running workshops are an excellent way to find new development
    ideas, but the present paper explores a different technique -- the
    rewrite.

- abstract: A JavaScript dialect of its mini-notation for pattern is
    created, enabling easy integration with creative coding tools and an
    accompanying technique for visually annotating the playback of
    TidalCycles patterns over time. TidalCycles has rapidly become the
    most popular system for many styles of live coding performance, in
    particular Algoraves. We created a JavaScript dialect of its
    mini-notation for pattern, enabling easy integration with creative
    coding tools. Our research pairs a formalism describing the
    mini-notation with a small JavaScript library for generating events
    over time; this library is suitable for generating events inside of
    an AudioWorkletProcessor thread and for assisting with scheduling in
    JavaScript environments more generally. We describe integrating the
    library into the two live coding systems, Gibber and Hydra, and
    discuss an accompanying technique for visually annotating the
    playback of TidalCycles patterns over time.

- abstract: In this paper we introduce "version zero" of TidalVortex, an
    alternative implementation of the TidalCycles live coding system,
    using the Python programming language.  This is open-ended work,
    exploring what happens when we try to extract the 'essence' of a
    system like TidalCycles and translate it into another programming
    language, while taking advantage of the affordance of its new host.
    First, we review the substantial prior art in porting TidalCycles,
    and in representing musical patterns in Python. We then compare
    equivalent patterns written in Haskell (TidalCycles) and Python
    (TidalVortex), and relate implementation details of how functional
    reactive paradigms have translated from the pure functional,
    strongly typed Haskell to the more multi-paradigm, dynamically typed
    Python. Finally, we conclude with reflections and generalisable
    outcomes.

  title: TidalVortex Zero
  URL: "https://zenodo.org/record/6456380"
- abstract: This paper brings together two main perspectives on
    algorithmic pattern. First, the writing of musical patterns in live
    coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles.
    In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human
    and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the
    results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile
    approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as
    algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting,
    interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual
    definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating
    sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic
    pattern in a wider activity of making.

- abstract: This is an improvised, from-scratch live coding performance.
    The NIME interface which this performance showcases is the new
    Feedfoward editor for the TidalCycles live coding environment.
    Feedforward is written in Haskell using the ncurses library for
    terminal-based user interfaces. It runs on low-powered hardware
    including the Raspberry Pi Zero, with formative testing of
    prototypes conducted with several groups of children between the
    ages of 8 and 14. Feedforward has a number of features designed to
    support improvised, multi-pattern live coding. Individual Tidal
    patterns are addressable with hotkeys for fast mute and unmuting.
    Each pattern has a stereo VU meter, to aid the quick matching of
    sound to pattern within a mix. In addition, TidalCycles has been
    extended to store context with each event, so that source code
    positions in its polyrhythmic sequence mini-notation are tracked.
    This allows steps to be highlighted in the source code when- ever
    they are active. This works even when Tidal combinators have been
    applied to manipulate the timeline. Formal evaluation has yet to
    take place, but this feature appears to support learning of how
    pattern manipulations work in Tidal. Feedforward and TidalCycles is
    free/open source software under a GPL licence version 3.0.

# Introduction

This paper introduces Strudel (or sometimes 'StrudelCycles'), an
alternative implementation of the Tidal (or 'TidalCycles') live coding
system, using the JavaScript programming language. Strudel is an attempt
to make live coding more accessible, by creating a system that runs
entirely in the browser, while opening Tidal's approach to algorithmic
patterns [@https://zenodo.org/record/4299661] up to modern audio/visual
web technologies. The Strudel REPL is a live code editor dedicated to
manipulating strudel patterns while they play, with builtin visual
feedback. While Strudel is written in JavaScript, the API is optimized
for simplicity and readability by applying code transformations on the
syntax tree level, allowing language operations that would otherwise be
impossible. The application supports multiple ways to output sound,
including Tone.js, Web Audio nodes, OSC (Open Sound Control) messages,
Web Serial and Web MIDI. The project is split into multiple packages,
allowing granular reuse in other applications. Apart from TidalCycles,
Strudel draws inspiration from prior projects like TidalVortex

and Feedforward [@https://zenodo.org/record/6353969].

# Porting from Haskell

The original Tidal is implemented as a domain specific language (DSL),
embedded in the Haskell pure functional programming language, taking
advantage of Haskell's terse syntax and advanced, 'strong' type system.
Javascript on the other hand, is a multi-paradigm programming language,
with a dynamic type system. Because Tidal leans heavily on many of
Haskell's more unique features, it was not always clear that it could
meaningfully be ported to a multi-paradigm scripting language. However,
this already proved to be the case with an earlier port to Python
\[TidalVortex; @https://zenodo.org/record/6456380\], and we have now
successfully implemented Tidal's pure functional representation of
patterns in Strudel, including partial application, and functor,
applicative and monad structures. Over the past few months since the
project started in January 2022, a large part of Tidal's functionality
has already been ported, including it's mini-notation for polymetric
sequences, and a large part of its library of pattern manipulations. The
result is a terse and highly composable system, where just about
everything is a pattern, that may be transformed and combined with other
patterns in a myriad of ways.

# Representing Patterns

Patterns are the essence of Tidal. Its patterns are abstract entities
that represent flows of time as functions, adapting a technique called
pure functional reactive programming. Taking a time span as its input, a
Pattern can output a set of events that happen within that time span. It
depends on the structure of the Pattern how the events are located in
time. From now on, this process of generating events from a time span
will be called **querying**. Example:

<MiniRepl tune={`const pattern = sequence(c3, [e3, g3]);
const events = pattern.query(0, 1);
console.log(events.map(e => e.show()))`} />

In this example, we create a pattern using the `sequence` function and
**query** it for the time span from `0` to `1`. Those numbers represent
units of time called **cycles**. The length of one cycle depends on the
tempo, which defaults to one cycle per second. The resulting events are:

<MiniRepl tune={`[{ value: 'c3', begin: 0, end: 1/2 },
{ value: 'e3', begin: 1/2, end: 3/4 },
{ value: 'g3', begin: 3/4, end: 1 }]`} />

Each event has a value, a begin time and an end time, where time is
represented as a fraction. In the above case, the events are placed in
sequential order, where c3 takes the first half, and e3 and g3 together
take the second half. This temporal placement is the result of the
`sequence` function, which divides its arguments equally over one cycle.
If an argument is an array, the same rule applies to that part of the
cycle. In the example, e3 and g3 are divided equally over the second
half of the whole cycle.

In the REPL, the user only has to type in the pattern itself, the
querying will be handled by the scheduler. The scheduler will repeatedly
query the pattern for events, which then will be used for playback.

# Making Patterns

In practice, the end-user live coder will not deal with constructing
patterns directly, but will rather build patterns using Strudel's
extensive combinator library to create, combine and transform patterns.

The live coder may use the `sequence` function as already seen above, or
more often the mini-notation for even terser notation of rhythmic
sequences. Such sequences are often treated only a starting point for
manipulation, where they then are undergo pattern transformations such
as repetition, symmetry, interference/combination or randomisation,
potentially at multiple timescales. Because Strudel patterns are
represented as pure functions of time rather than as data structures,
very long and complex generative results can be represented and
manipulated without having to store the resulting sequences in memory.

# Pattern Example

The following example showcases how patterns can be utilized to create
musical complexity from simple parts, using repetition and interference:

<MiniRepl tune={`"<0 2 [4 6](3,4,1) 3*2>".scale('D minor')
.off(1/4, scaleTranspose(2))
.off(1/2, scaleTranspose(6))
.legato(.5)
.echo(4, 1/8, .5)
.tone((await piano()).chain(out()))
.pianoroll()`} />

The pattern starts with a rhythm of numbers in mini notation, which are
interpreted inside the scale of D minor. Without the scale function, the
first line can be expressed as:

<MiniRepl tune={`"<d3 f3 [a3 c3](3, 4, 1) g3*2>"`} />

This line could also be expressed without mini notation:

<MiniRepl tune={`slowcat(d3, f3, [a3, c3].euclid(3, 4, 1), g3.fast(2))`} />

Here is a short description of all the functions used:

-   slowcat: play elements sequentially, where each lasts one cycle
-   brackets: elements inside brackets are divided equally over the time
    of their parent
-   euclid(p, s, o): place p pulses evenly over s steps, with offset o
    [@https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi_x61_10.1.1.72.1340]
-   fast(n): speed up by n. `g3.fast(2)` will play g3 two times.
-   off(n, f): copy each event, offset it by n cycles and apply function
    f
-   legato(n): multiply duration of event with n
-   echo(t, n, v): copy each event t times, with n cycles in between
    each copy, decreasing velocity by v
-   tone(instrument): play back each event with the given Tone.js
    instrument
-   pianoroll(): visualize events as midi notes in a pianoroll

# Future Outlook

The project is still young, with many features on the horizon. As
general guiding principles, Strudel aims to be

1.  accessible
2.  as compatible as possible with Tidal
3.  modular and extensible

The main accessibility advantage over Tidal is the zero install browser
environment. While Strudel can control Tidal's SuperDirt audio system
via OSC, it requires the user to install SuperCollider and its
sc3plugins library, which can be difficult. Without SuperDirt, Strudel
is able to output sound itself via Tone.js, however this is limited both
in terms of available features and runtime performance. For the future,
it is planned to integrate alternative sound engines such as glicol
[@{https://webaudioconf.com/posts/2021_8/}] and faust
[@{https://webaudioconf.com/posts/2019_38/}]. To improve compatibility
with Tidal, more Tidal functions are planned to be ported, as well as
full compatibility with SuperDirt. Besides sound, other ways to render
events are being explored, such as graphical, and choreographic output.
We are also looking into alternative ways of editing patterns, including
multi-user editing for network music, parsing a novel syntax to escape
the constraints of javascript, and developing hardware/e-textile
interfaces.
